# Graduate Admissions

## Introduction 

A rising level of pursuing higher education in general population has introduced a great competition among applicants. Therefore, both students and parents pay careful attention to the factors that will lead to a higher chance of admission. In China, the examination score of the “Gaokao” is the sole factor that decides a student’s admission to the college. However, in other countries, there are multiple factors that could influence one’s admission to graduate school. Some obvious variables such as GPA, TOEFL score and GRE score, which directly indicate one’s learning abilities and English proficiency, are considered to be core standards by some college admission committee and have a direct impact on student’s admission. It is commonly known that the higher the GPA or TOEFL or GRE score a student can get, the bigger the chance they will be able to get an offer from a college. However, some universities might not consider score as important as we thought. They might value other implicit variables more important, such as the student’s undergraduate university ranking, statement of purpose, the strength of recommendation letter and research experience. Therefore it is hard to predict the admission chance just based on scores using simple linear regression. In addition, different admission committees in different universities might value these variables differently. Some committees consider a higher undergraduate program ranking indicates a greater possibility of success. Some committees think a strong letter recommendation from a well-known professor shows a bigger chance of academic success in graduate school. Some committees consider research experience during undergraduate is a good indicator of research potential and ability. Hence, in this project, we obtain a dataset of students’ admission information to one particular graduate school. We will take a basic look at the dataset and conclude which variables are crucial for admission to this graduate school. We will take into account all the variables mentioned above and develop an admission prediction model by using Machine Learning algorithms. Moreover, we could generalize the model to work with different graduate school student admission data, to compensate for the fact that different universities have different admission standards.
